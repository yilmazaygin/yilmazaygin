#  True complexity lies in achieving simplicity.

## About Me
I am a computer scientist with a deep passion for exploring both **low-level computing** and **high-level abstractions**.  
My journey is rooted in **C** — a language at the heart of my work and one that fuels my curiosity for how computers truly operate.  
Alongside C, I work with **Python** (with libraries such as `async`, `dataclasses`, and `abstract base classes`), as well as **Flask**, **Django**, and **Linux**.
I also admire the beauty of **Assembly** applications.

I enjoy designing **architectures**, building **systems from the ground up**, and bringing **order out of complexity**—not merely writing code but crafting robust foundations.

## Currently Working On
- Designing and building my own physical **16-bit breadboard computer**, including crafting a **custom Hish Level language & its own Assembly language** for it.

## Currently Learning
- **Domain Driven Design (DDD)** — refining my architectural mindset for scalable, maintainable systems.

## Selected Projects
- [why-gamblers-lose](https://github.com/yilmazaygin/why-gamblers-lose)
- *(Projects will be shared gradually as I re-organize my repositories.)*

## Important Note
My GitHub profile is currently being **restructured for better branding and clarity**.  
Repositories are being revised and will be made public step by step as I refine and document them.  
Stay tuned for upcoming projects!
