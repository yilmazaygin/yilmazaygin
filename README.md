#  True complexity lies in achieving simplicity.

## About Me
I am a computer scientist with a deep passion for exploring both **low-level computing** and **high-level abstractions**.  
My journey is rooted in **C** — a language at the heart of my work and one that fuels my curiosity for how computers truly operate.  
Alongside C, I work with **Python**.

I enjoy designing **architectures**, building **systems from the ground up**, and bringing **order out of complexity**—not merely writing code but crafting robust foundations.

## Important Note
My GitHub profile is currently being **restructured for better branding and clarity**.  
Repositories are being revised and will be made public step by step as I refine and document them.  
Stay tuned for upcoming projects!
